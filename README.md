# ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)

For my project, I decided to focus on the differences between the different kinds dwarf stars. 


## Figure 1
For my first graph, I started simple and decided to see if there is a relationship between the absolute magnitude and the radius of all the dwarf stars.

Based on this image, there doesn't seem to be any clear correlation.

## Figure 2
In this graph, I wanted to compare the individual dwarf stars (brown, red, and white) and their average luminosity to eachother. I decided that a bar graph would be the best way to represent this information.

Based on this graph, we can see that Red Dwarf stars have the greater average luminosity, then white, and finally brown. 

## Figure 3
I wanted to take a step further and compare all the different values of the dwarf stars (so their temperature, luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude). First, I decided to get the average values of each category for the brown, red, and white dwarf stars. After that, I put them into scientific notation and scraped off the *10^x. I did this in order to standardize the values and make the graph legible. After that, I realized I made a huge mistake and misrepresented the star values for some of the categories (temperature and luminosity). This is because, using the method I had done, 1000 and 100 would both be represented as 1. Instead, for the values where there were extra significant digits, I divided by either 100 or 1000 in order to show that 1000>100. This was the result:

Based on this grpah, we can easily compare the values of the dwarf stars.
